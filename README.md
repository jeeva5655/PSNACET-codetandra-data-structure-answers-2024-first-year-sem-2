I have uploaded these codes to assist students who do not have the time to write code themselves and who are mainly concentrating on their semester exams. The intention behind this is to provide them with educational resources that can help them understand key concepts without the pressure of coding from scratch. These codes are meant to serve as learning tools, offering guidance and support to those who need it during their exam preparations.
